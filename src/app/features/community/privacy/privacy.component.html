    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <small>Last Updated: May 1, 2025</small>

    <p>
        Fwollo LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to
        protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
        disclose, and safeguard your information when you access or use the Pulse Up mobile
        application, website, and related services (collectively, the "Service").
    </p>

    <p>By using the Service, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1.1 Personal Information</h3>
    <p>
        We may collect the following personal information when you create an account or interact
        with the Service:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Phone Number (required for pulsing and topic creation)</li>
        <li>Email Address (optional)</li>
        <li>Apple ID or Google ID (if used for sign-in)</li>
        <li>Username (publicly displayed on topics you create)</li>
        <li>Display Name (publicly displayed on topics you create)</li>
        <li>Additional Profile Information (optional, subject to your visibility settings)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Your phone number and email address will always remain confidential and are never publicly
        displayed.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2 Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We collect usage data to improve the Service, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Topics you create, search for, or view</li>
        <li>Pulsing activity (support expressions)</li>
        <li>Interaction patterns within the Service, including clicks and feature usage</li>
        <li>Engagement statistics (e.g., screen time)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Device and Location Information</h3>
    <p>We automatically collect certain information about your device, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device type, operating system, and application version</li>
        <li>IP address (used for security and fraud prevention)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>Location Data:</strong><br />
        Your approximate location (city, state, or country level) may be used for generating
        heatmaps and trending data. Pulse Up never shares your precise location or any identifiable
        activity history with other users. While aggregate engagement data may be used to improve
        the platform, individual pulse actions are never publicly linked to user identities.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide, maintain, and enhance the Service</li>
        <li>To verify identities and prevent spam or abuse</li>
        <li>To enforce topic uniqueness and resolve disputes</li>
        <li>To generate aggregated analytics such as heatmaps and trending topics</li>
        <li>To personalize your experience and recommend relevant content</li>
        <li>To notify you about activity on topics you support</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations and maintain security</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell personal information. However, we may share your information as follows:</p>

    <h3>3.1 Third-Party Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
        We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who assist in operating the
        Service, such as hosting providers, analytics companies, or security firms. These providers
        are bound by strict confidentiality obligations.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Legal Compliance and Security</h3>
    <p>
        We may disclose your information if required by law, legal processes, government requests,
        or to protect our rights, security, and property or that of others.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Business Transfers</h3>
    <p>
        In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of Pulse Up or its assets, your data may be
        transferred. Users will be informed of any significant changes in data ownership or
        practices.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Pulsing, Topic Visibility, and Anonymity</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Pulsing Privacy</h3>
    <p>
        Pulses (support actions) are not publicly linked to your identity. Other users cannot
        identify how you pulsed.
    </p>
    <p>We internally track pulses to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provide accurate counts</li>
        <li>Prevent duplicate pulsing</li>
        <li>Manage platform functionality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Individual pulsing activity is not displayed publicly or disclosed outside our internal
        administrative processes.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Topic Creation Visibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your username and display name are publicly displayed as the creator of topics.</li>
        <li>
            Topics remain publicly visible even if you delete your account, but are labeled as
            "Created by a Former User."
        </li>
        <li>
            Your phone number and email address remain private and are never displayed publicly.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Disputes, Topic Transfers, and Username Claims</h2>
    <p>
        We may transfer topic ownership or usernames in response to verified claims of trademark
        infringement, official organizational representation, or impersonation. Users involved in
        disputes may have their data reviewed internally for claim verification purposes, but no
        personal information will be publicly disclosed.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access,
        alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no security system is entirely foolproof,
        and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <h3>7.1 Access and Correction</h3>
    <p>
        You may access, review, and update your account information at any time within the Service.

        >. <br />
        Topics you created will remain visible but labeled as "Created by a Former User." <br />
        Your pulses remain stored for aggregate analytics and cannot be individually deleted.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We retain your personal information as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in
        this policy or as required by law. Pulsing data may be retained indefinitely for analytical
        purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>
        The Service operates in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the U.S.,
        you consent to your data being transferred to, processed, and stored in the United States,
        which may have different data protection laws than your jurisdiction.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        The Service is not intended for individuals under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from
        children under 13. If we discover a child under 13 has provided personal information, we
        will delete it in compliance with applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Clarification on Legal and Regulatory Neutrality</h2>

        Pulse Up is <strong>not</strong> a voting or polling platform in any legal, governmental, or
        electoral sense.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>It does not conduct elections, referenda, or scientific surveys.</li>
        <li>
            All expressions of support ("pulses") are intended for public awareness, sentiment
            exploration, and advocacy.
        </li>
        <li>
            No part of the Service constitutes or substitutes for official voting or polling
            mechanisms.
        </li>
        <li>
            Insights and trends provided on the platform are not representative of official public
            opinion metrics.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>12. Changes to the Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of significant changes
