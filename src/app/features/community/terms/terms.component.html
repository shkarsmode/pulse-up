    <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
    <small>Last Updated: May 1, 2025</small>

    <p>
        Welcome to Pulse Up. These Terms of Use (the "Terms") govern your use of the Pulse Up mobile
        application, website, and any related services (collectively, the "Service") provided by
        Fwollo LLC ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By downloading, accessing, or using Pulse Up,
        you agree to be legally bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may
        not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be at least 13 years old to use Pulse Up.</li>
        <li>
            By using Pulse Up, you confirm you meet this age requirement and all other eligibility
            criteria.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. License and Permitted Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable license to use
            Pulse Up solely for personal and non-commercial purposes.
        </li>
        <li>You may not use the Service for any illegal, fraudulent, or harmful activities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Account Creation and Authentication</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may create accounts through verified mobile phone numbers, email addresses, Apple
            ID, or Google ID.
        </li>
        <li>
            A valid mobile phone number is mandatory to:
            <ul>
                <li>Support ("pulse") topics.</li>
                <li>Create new topics.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>VoIP, landlines, and non-mobile numbers are prohibited for account verification.</li>
        <li>
            Phone verification ensures account authenticity, reduces spam, and maintains topic
            integrity.
        </li>
        <li>
            If an account is initially created using email, Apple ID, or Google ID, phone
            verification may still be required for pulsing or topic creation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Users can optionally set a public display name, visible alongside their username on
            topics they create.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your phone number and email address remain confidential and are never publicly
            displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Pulsing, Anonymity, and Location Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All pulses (expressions of support) are anonymous; users cannot view the identity of
            other supporters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Popular and trending topics are determined by the total number of pulses received within
            specified timeframes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your approximate location (city, state, or country level) may be used for generating
            heatmaps and trending data. Pulse Up never shares your precise location or any
            identifiable activity history with other users. While aggregate engagement data may be
            used to improve the platform, individual pulse actions are never publicly linked to user
            identities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Topic and Username Ownership and Disputes</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Topic Ownership and Uniqueness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Topic names must be unique; exact duplicates are prohibited, although similar variations
            are allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Topics created on Pulse Up are public and do not grant exclusive ownership rights to the
            creator.
        </li>
        <li>Initial creators manage topic content but retain no exclusive rights.</li>
        <li>Pulse Up reserves the right to transfer topics upon verification of valid claims.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Topic Creation and Public Visibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating a topic publicly displays the creator’s username and display name.</li>
        <li>
            Deleting your account does not remove the topics you've created; they remain public.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your email address and phone number will always remain private and are never publicly
            displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Handling Topic Disputes and Transfer Requests</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may request topic transfers if they can provide sufficient evidence of:
            <ul>
                <li>Trademark ownership.</li>
                <li>Official representation of a brand, organization, or public figure.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Topics with low engagement may be transferred more readily than highly engaged topics.
        </li>
        <li>During disputes, topics remain active to avoid disruption.</li>
        <li>
            Users may challenge a claim if they believe their topic should remain under their
            control.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.4 Username Ownership and Transferability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Usernames must be unique.</li>
        <li>
            Pulse Up may transfer a username upon verified requests from:
            <ul>
                <li>Trademark owners.</li>
                <li>Official business, organization, or public figure representatives.</li>
                <li>Users whose usernames infringe upon trademarks or misrepresent entities.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Users will be notified of any username transfers and permitted to choose an alternative
            username.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Dynamic Pricing for Claims</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users requesting transfers of topics or usernames must pay a non-refundable claim
            verification fee.
        </li>
        <li>Fees are based on the topic or username’s engagement level.</li>
        <li>
            Approved claims result in topic or username transfers. Denied claims do not result in
            fee refunds.
        </li>
        <li>Frivolous or repeated claims may lead to warnings, suspensions, or bans.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. App Licensing and Restrictions (End User License Agreement - EULA)</h2>
    <h3>7.1 License Grant</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users receive a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use Pulse
            Up on personal devices.

            You are prohibited from:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Modifying, reverse-engineering, decompiling, or extracting Pulse Up’s source
                    code.
                </li>
                <li>Reselling, renting, leasing, or sublicensing the Service.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.3 Termination of License</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Your license automatically terminates upon violation of these Terms.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to revoke your access to Pulse Up at any time, for any reason.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Topic Moderation, Reporting, and Enforcement</h2>
    <h3>8.1 Reporting Topics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may report topics that contain inappropriate content, spam, manipulation,
            trademark, or copyright infringement.
        </li>
        <li>
            Users are reminded that disagreement with a topic's viewpoint alone is not grounds for
            reporting. Topics will not be removed solely because they support a candidate, country,
            cause, or belief that others disagree with. Users are encouraged to create or support
            counter-topics as the platform elevates the most supported topics.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.2 Content Review and Removal</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pulse Up reserves the right to remove topics containing violence, threats, hate speech,
            explicit material, targeted harassment, or promoting illegal activities.
        </li>
        <li>Disagreement with viewpoints alone is insufficient grounds for topic removal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.3 User Suspensions and Bans</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may face suspension or permanent bans for:
            <ul>
                <li>Consistently posting harmful, misleading, or rule-violating content.</li>
                <li>Abusing the reporting system.</li>
                <li>Employing bots or automation tools to manipulate engagement metrics.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Copyright and DMCA Compliance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users are solely responsible for all content they upload or post. Users must ensure
            content does not infringe third-party copyrights, trademarks, or intellectual property
            rights.
        </li>
        <li>
