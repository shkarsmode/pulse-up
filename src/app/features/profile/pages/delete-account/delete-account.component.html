            Deleting your account will permanently remove your profile and all associated voting
            history. However, any votes cast prior to deletion will remain valid for 24 hours from
            the time they were made.
        </p>
        <p class="delete-account__text">
            After deletion, you will have the option to create a new account using the same phone
            number or email. The new account will not retain any of the voting history from your
            previous account.

            To prevent abuse, you may not be able to create a new account using the same credentials
            for 24 hours after deletion.
