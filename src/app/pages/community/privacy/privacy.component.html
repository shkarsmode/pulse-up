    <h3>3.1 Third-Party Service Providers</h3>

        We may share data with trusted third-party service providers who assist
        in operating the Service, such as hosting providers, analytics
        companies, or security firms. These providers are bound by strict
        confidentiality obligations.

    <h2>4. Voting, Topic Visibility, and Anonymity</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Voting Privacy</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Votes ("pulses") are not publicly linked to your identity. Other
            users cannot identify how you voted.
        </li>
        <li>
            We internally track votes to provide accurate vote counts, prevent
            duplicate voting, and manage platform functionality. However,
            individual voting activity is not displayed publicly or disclosed
            outside our internal administrative processes.

            of topics.
        </li>
        <li>
            Topics remain publicly visible even if you delete your account but
            are labeled as "Created by a Former User."
        </li>
        <li>
            Your phone number and email address remain private and are never
            displayed publicly.
        </li>

    <h2>5. Disputes, Topic Transfers, and Username Claims</h2>
    <p>
        We may transfer topic ownership or usernames in response to verified
        claims of trademark infringement, official organizational
        representation, or impersonation. Users involved in disputes may have
        their data reviewed internally for claim verification purposes but no
        personal information will be publicly disclosed.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        We implement appropriate security measures to protect your data from
        unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no
        security system is entirely foolproof, and absolute security cannot be
        guaranteed.
