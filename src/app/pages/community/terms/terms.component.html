    <small>Last Updated: March 30, 2025</small>

    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Pulse Up</strong>. These Terms of Use (the "Terms")
        govern your use of the Pulse Up mobile application, website, and any
        related services (collectively, the "Service") provided by
        <strong>Fwollo LLC</strong> ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"). By
        downloading, accessing, or using Pulse Up, you agree to be legally bound
        by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the
        Service.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use Pulse Up.
        </li>
        <li>
            By using Pulse Up, you confirm you meet this age requirement and all
            other eligibility criteria.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. License and Permitted Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and
            revocable license to use Pulse Up solely for personal and
            non-commercial purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
            You may not use the Service for any illegal, fraudulent, or harmful
            activities.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Account Creation and Authentication</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may create accounts through verified mobile phone numbers,
            email addresses, Apple ID, or Google ID.
        </li>
        <li>
            A valid mobile phone number is mandatory to:
            <ul>
                <li>Vote (“pulse”) on topics.</li>
                <li>Create new topics.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            VoIP, landlines, and non-mobile numbers are prohibited for account
            verification.
        </li>
        <li>
            Phone verification ensures account authenticity, reduces spam, and
            maintains topic integrity.
        </li>
        <li>
            If an account is initially created using email, Apple ID, or Google
            ID, phone verification may still be required for voting or topic
            creation.
        </li>
        <li>
            Users can optionally set a public display name, visible alongside
            their username on topics they create.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your phone number and email address remain confidential and are
            never publicly displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Voting, Anonymity, and Location Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            All pulses (votes) are anonymous; users cannot view the identity of
            voters.
        </li>
        <li>
            Popular and trending topics are determined by the total number of
            pulses received within specified timeframes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your approximate location (city, state, or country level) may be
            used for generating heatmaps and trending data. Precise locations
            are never shared with other users.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Topic and Username Ownership and Disputes</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Topic Ownership and Uniqueness</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Topic names must be unique; exact duplicates are prohibited,
            although similar variations are allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Topics created on Pulse Up are public and do not grant exclusive
            ownership rights to the creator.
        </li>
        <li>
            Initial creators manage topic content but retain no exclusive
            rights.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pulse Up reserves the right to transfer topics upon verification of
            valid claims.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.2 Topic Creation and Public Visibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Creating a topic publicly displays the creator’s username and
            display name.
        </li>
        <li>
            Deleting your account does not remove the topics you've created;
            they remain public.
        </li>
        <li>
            Your email address and phone number will always remain private and
            are never publicly displayed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Handling Topic Disputes and Transfer Requests</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may request topic transfers if they can provide sufficient
            evidence of:
            <ul>
                <li>Trademark ownership.</li>
                <li>
                    Official representation of a brand, organization, or public
                    figure.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Topics with low engagement may be transferred more readily than
            highly engaged topics.
        </li>
        <li>During disputes, topics remain active to avoid disruption.</li>
        <li>
            Users may challenge a claim if they believe their topic should
            remain under their control.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.4 Username Ownership and Transferability</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Usernames must be unique.</li>
        <li>
            Pulse Up may transfer a username upon verified requests from:
            <ul>
                <li>Trademark owners.</li>
                <li>
                    Official business, organization, or public figure
                    representatives.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Users whose usernames infringe upon trademarks or
                    misrepresent entities.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Users will be notified of any username transfers and permitted to
            choose an alternative username.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Dynamic Pricing for Claims</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users requesting transfers of topics or usernames must pay a
            non-refundable claim verification fee.
        </li>
        <li>Fees are based on the topic or username’s engagement level.</li>
        <li>
            Approved claims result in topic or username transfers. Denied claims
            do not result in fee refunds.
        </li>
        <li>
            Frivolous or repeated claims may lead to warnings, suspensions, or
            bans.
        </li>
    </ul>

            Modifying, reverse-engineering, decompiling, or extracting Pulse Up’s source code.
        </li>

    <h2>8. Topic Moderation, Reporting, and Enforcement</h2>
    <h3>8.1 Reporting Topics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Users may report topics that contain inappropriate content, spam,
            manipulation, trademark, or copyright infringement.
        </li>
        <li>
            Users are reminded that disagreement with a topic's viewpoint alone
            is not grounds for reporting. Topics will not be removed solely
            because they support a candidate, country, cause, or belief that
            others disagree with. Users are encouraged to create or support
            counter-topics as the platform elevates the most supported topics.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.2 Content Review and Removal</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Pulse Up reserves the right to remove topics containing violence,
            threats, hate speech, explicit material, targeted harassment, or
            promoting illegal activities.
        </li>
        <li>
            Disagreement with viewpoints alone is insufficient grounds for topic
            removal.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>8.3 User Suspensions and Bans</h3>
    <p>Users may face suspension or permanent bans for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Consistently posting harmful, misleading, or rule-violating content.
        </li>
        <li>Abusing the reporting system.</li>
        <li>
            Employing bots or automation tools to manipulate engagement metrics.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <li>
