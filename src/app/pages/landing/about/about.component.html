                <p class="section__text">
                    Every day, causes and concerns shape our world — but too often, what gets
                    amplified is shaped by algorithms, not people. Truth gets buried under outrage,
                    popularity, or manipulation.
                </p>
                <p class="section__text">We built Pulse Up to change that.</p>
                <p class="section__text">
                    With one tap, you can show support for what matters to you — instantly,
                    anonymously, and without being drowned out.

                <p class="section__text">
                    It’s not a popularity contest. It’s a real-time pulse of what people truly care
                    about.

                    A New Way to Show Support, Without Fear or Barriers

                    For centuries, people have marched, protested, and rallied to show support for
                    change. But that’s not always easy — it can come with risks, backlash, or simply
                    not feeling safe to speak up.
